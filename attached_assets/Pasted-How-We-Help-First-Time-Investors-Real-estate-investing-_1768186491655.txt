First Time Investors
Real estate investing can be a great way to build wealth and diversify your portfolio. If you already own a primary residence, you have a unique advantage over others who are just starting out: you have experience buying and maintaining a property. However, investing in real estate is a different game altogether, and there are many factors to consider before taking the plunge.

Identifying the Right Properties
The first step in real estate investing is identifying the right properties to invest in. As a first-time investor, it’s best to start with properties that are familiar to you, such as single-family homes, condos, and residential multi-family dwellings. These types of properties are easier to manage and require less capital to get started.
 

When it comes to identifying the right properties to invest in, there are a few key factors to consider:
 

Location: The location of the property can have a big impact on its potential value and rental income. Look for properties in desirable locations that are close to amenities such as schools, shopping centers, and public transportation.
 

Condition: The condition of the property is also an important consideration. Look for properties that are well-maintained and in good condition. Avoid properties that require extensive repairs or renovations, as these can be costly and time-consuming.
 

Market demand: Consider the demand for rental properties in the area. Look for areas where there is high demand for rentals and low vacancy rates. This can help ensure that the property will be easy to rent out and generate a steady stream of income.
 

Potential for appreciation: Look for properties that have the potential to appreciate in value over time. This can help ensure that the investment will generate a good return on investment if you decide to sell the property in the future.
 

Rental income potential: Look for properties that have the potential to generate a good rental income. Research similar properties in the area to get an idea of what rents are currently being charged and what you can realistically expect to charge for rent.
 

Type of property: As a first-time real estate investor, it’s a good idea to focus on single-family homes, condos, and residential multi-family dwellings. These types of properties are generally easier to manage and require less capital upfront than larger commercial properties.
 

By carefully considering these factors, you can identify properties that are likely to generate a good return on investment and help you achieve your investment goals. It’s also a good idea to work with a real estate agent  who can help you identify potential properties and provide guidance throughout the investment process.

Evaluating Risks and Returns
Real estate investing comes with risks, just like any other type of investment. Before making any investment, it’s important to evaluate the risks and potential returns. One common mistake made by first-time investors is underestimating the costs associated with owning a property. In addition to the mortgage payment, you’ll also need to account for property taxes, insurance, maintenance costs, and potential vacancies.
 

To determine the potential returns on a property, calculate the cap rate, which is the net operating income divided by the purchase price. The cap rate will give you a rough estimate of the property’s potential return on investment. However, keep in mind that there are many factors that can affect a property’s value and potential return, such as changes in the local market, changes in interest rates, and unexpected maintenance costs.
 

Here are some additional key factors to consider:
 

Rental income: One of the primary sources of return on investment in real estate is rental income. Look at the potential rental income of a property and compare it to the costs of owning and maintaining the property, including mortgage payments, property taxes, insurance, maintenance, and repairs. Make sure that the potential rental income is sufficient to cover these costs and still generate a profit.
 

Appreciation potential: Another potential source of return on investment is property appreciation. Research the historical appreciation rates for the area and compare them to the potential appreciation of the property you are considering. Keep in mind that property values can fluctuate based on market conditions and other factors, so it’s important to consider appreciation as a long-term investment strategy.
 

Cash flow: Cash flow is the amount of money left over after all expenses are paid. Positive cash flow is essential for maintaining and growing your investment. Look for properties that have the potential for positive cash flow, meaning that the rental income exceeds the expenses associated with owning and maintaining the property.
 

Market conditions: Real estate values and rental rates can be impacted by local market conditions. Consider factors such as job growth, population growth, and the overall economic health of the area. A strong local economy can increase demand for rental properties and lead to higher rents and property values.
 

Financing: Financing options can impact the overall returns on investment. Look at the different financing options available to you and consider the interest rates, fees, and terms associated with each option. Make sure that the financing you choose will allow you to generate a positive return on investment.
 

Risks: All investments come with risks. Consider the risks associated with different types of real estate investments, such as market volatility, property damage, and tenant defaults. Understanding and managing these risks is essential for protecting your investment and ensuring its long-term success.

As a first-time investor, traditional bank financing is likely your best option for financing a property purchase. Traditional bank loans offer lower interest rates and longer repayment terms than other types of financing, such as hard money loans or private financing. To qualify for a traditional bank loan, you’ll need to have a good credit score and a solid financial history.
 

Before applying for a loan, consider getting pre-approved to determine how much you can afford to borrow. This will give you a better idea of what types of properties you can afford to invest in. When evaluating loan options, consider factors such as interest rates, repayment terms, and closing costs. A local mortgage broker or banker can help you find the right loan for your needs.
 

Typically, you’ll need to meet the following qualifications for an investor loan at a minimum:
 

20% down payment: this is usually the bare minimum down payment with 25% down getting you better rates and terms.
 

Minimum 620 FICO Score: this is the absolute minimum but you will need a 740+ FICO to get the best rate and terms.  If you have at least a 680 FICO score, this is a great place to start as a first time investor.  You can buy with a lower FICO but will have to accept a higher interest rate in exchange for the higher risk associated with a lower FICO score.
 

Reserves of at least 6 months: this can be met via retirement accounts so is usually not an issue, even for first time investors.  The 6 months reserves refers to at least 6 months of the new housing payment in reserves post closing to insure you have a cushion in case of some minor financial hardship.
 

Interest rates and rental income offset: interest rates for investors are usually 0.375% to 0.5% higher than for owner occupied purchases, but can be as much as 1 – 1.5% higher depending on your down payment and credit score.  If you own your current residence, you will be able to use 75% of the rental income (as determined by the appraiser) to offset the new housing payment to help you qualify.  If you do not currently own your current residence and do not have at least 2 years experience with other rental real estate, you will have to qualify for the entire new housing payment.

Understanding Traditional Bank Financing Options
Calculating Your Individual Rate of Return
Finally, it’s important to calculate your individual rate of return on a property investment. This will help you determine whether the investment is worth the expense.
 

Individual Rate of Return (IRR) is a financial metric used to measure the profitability of an investment over time. It takes into account the amount of money invested, the cash flows generated by the investment, and the timing of those cash flows. Essentially, it helps an investor to determine whether their investment is generating enough returns to justify the risk taken.
 

To calculate IRR, you need to follow these steps:
 

Identify the amount of money invested in the property, which includes the purchase price, any additional costs associated with acquiring the property (such as closing costs or renovation expenses), and any ongoing expenses (such as property taxes, insurance, and maintenance costs).
 

Estimate the cash flows generated by the property over time, which include rental income, potential appreciation, and any other income streams such as coin-operated laundry machines or parking spaces. Be sure to take into account any vacancies or periods of negative cash flow.
 

Determine the timing of these cash flows. For example, if you plan to hold the property for 10 years, you’ll need to estimate the cash flows for each year.
 

Use a financial calculator or spreadsheet program to calculate the IRR. Essentially, this involves solving for the discount rate that makes the net present value of the cash flows equal to the initial investment.
 

Here’s an example: Let’s say you purchased a condo for $500,000 and put an additional $50,000 into renovations. You rent it out for $3,000 per month, and estimate that the property will appreciate in value by 5% per year. You plan to hold the property for 10 years before selling it.
